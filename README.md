# Project Haven
v.0.16

Current official version [here](http://h2o-game.net/haven/index.html)

Please keep in mind this game is only a training project and that it is in a too early stage to be really 'playable'.

Some of the visual assets may be under copyright, such as the background image (NASA), the blue planet, and the explosion sprite coming from Metal Slug I believe. These pictures will be replaced with personal ones to avoid any issue.
